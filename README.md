1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and make a new bot.
2. In bot tab, enable all the intents
3. Get a Token from the same tab
4. Clone this repository to your computer
5. Add .env in the directory and put into it: "TOKEN=[Your Own Bot Token]"
6. Open Party-Time-Bot project in an IDE and configure the server.py as main
7. Open terminal in the Party-Time-Bot directory and type "py -m pip install -r ./requirements.txt"

Note: Make sure to use python 3.10!
